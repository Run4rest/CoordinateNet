**Abstract**

This work brings to your attention an original solution of the BirdCLEF2023 problem which exceeds the results of [1] and BirdNET of [2] with architecture simpler than EffitientNet b0. The achieved validation accuracy is 0.89 after 20 epoches (vs 0.75 of [1] and 0.78 of [2]) for 264 birds. 
In this work I demonstrate a new approach for spectrogram classification and offer my readers to go far this way for better results.  As you will see there is a lot of room to further improve speed/accuracy ratio.
